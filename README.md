# Cadmus Layers Shell

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.9.

This shell hosts a Cadmus library including layer services and related models. These have been copied from the original Cadmus core library, and updated for better TS compliance. In future, this library together with other libraries derived from the original Cadmus core library will replace it.

TODO: create a library to host the layer demo component once this can replace the same library in the original Cadmus workspace.
